# Futurized Python-3-compatible Transitfeed fork

This repo contains a fork of the Google [`transitfeed`](https://github.com/google/transitfeed) project. We have run the Python Future `futurize` command on the codebase to work towards Python 3 compatibility. We also made a couple of adjustments to address errors that were raised in use cases we encountered in our usage of the tool.
